# Ansteel Evidence-First Reviews

`pi --ansteel` runs a non-interactive, evidence-first engineering collaboration under mandatory three-role governance:

- Tech Lead independently investigates, publishes a work card, challenges peer claims, responds to assigned challenges, and verifies each revision.
- Staff Engineer independently investigates, publishes a work card, challenges peer claims, responds to assigned challenges, and verifies each revision.
- QA Engineer independently investigates, publishes a work card, challenges peer claims, responds to assigned challenges, and verifies each revision.

All three roles normally use explicitly configured, distinct `provider/model` values. This is a configuration-identity check, not proof that the configured names reach distinct backend models, provider endpoints, or providers. There is no fourth reviewer or sign-off role. A review is approved only after all three revised work cards pass independent verification, Tech Lead writes consensus, and both Staff Engineer and QA Engineer explicitly sign off on that immutable text. The protocol makes uncertainty and verification work visible; it does not guarantee that a model response is correct.

## Run a review

From the project being reviewed, first create the required `.pi/ansteel.json` configuration, then run:

```bash
pi --ansteel "Review the motor safety change"
```

`--ansteel` uses non-interactive output. It prints a stage-progress line as each role begins, completes, fails, or times out. At completion it prints the complete discussion transcript, followed by the result and path to the saved Markdown report, for example:

```text
Ansteel review approved: /project/.pi/ansteel-reports/ansteel-2026-07-22-10-30-00-review-the-motor-safety-change.md
```

There is no fallback to the current Pi model. Before naming each role model, make sure it is available and authenticated in Pi. Use `/login`, `pi --list-models`, and the normal [Providers](providers.md) and [Custom models](models.md) setup as needed.

## Run an interactive team

`--ansteel` is a bounded review that exits. For ordinary project work with three persistent roles, start Pi in interactive mode and use the built-in team command instead:

```text
/ansteel-team start "Review the motor safety change"
/ansteel-team ask "Compare the encoder implementations and identify the next safe task"
/ansteel-team status
/ansteel-team stop
```

`start` creates or resumes a dedicated Pi session for Tech Lead, Staff Engineer, and QA Engineer using the role models in `.pi/ansteel.json`. A new team first performs three independent investigations, then a public cross-examination round. `ask` continues the work with each role's private session history plus the same public collaboration ledger. Role responses are shown in the host Pi timeline as public updates; hidden reasoning and raw provider payloads are not shared.

Project state lives under `.pi/ansteel-team/`: `team.json` records the team, role-session locations, immutable task-owner policy, task ownership, evidence packages, and peer verdicts; `events.jsonl` is an append-only public ledger. `stop` disposes live role sessions but retains these files so a later `start` can resume the team. Resume requires the current `teamTaskOwners` configuration to match the persisted policy. Starting a different topic requires removing or archiving the existing team state first.

## Interactive change gate

Interactive roles use ordinary project tools, but code changes are governed by three task tools:

1. The intended owner calls `ansteel_claim_task` with a unique `TASK-...` ID, exact project-relative file paths, a description, and acceptance criteria.
2. Only that owner can use `edit` or `write` on those exact files. All other paths, all other roles, and a submitted task are blocked. Direct `bash` is inspection-only; it cannot be used to bypass the file gate.
3. The owner calls `ansteel_submit_change` with one supported test/check command. Pi runs it, records the actual stdout/stderr and exit result, captures the Git diff for exactly the claimed files, and freezes that evidence package.
4. Tech Lead and QA, or the two roles other than the owner, receive the same frozen test output and diff concurrently. Their current review replies are not shown to each other. Each must call `ansteel_review_task` with `approve` or `reject`; a rejection requires a concrete issue.
5. Both peer approvals mark the task `approved`. Any peer rejection returns it to `revision-required`; the owner must change it, run a new test, and submit a new diff. QA has the same immediate return authority and cannot be bypassed.

An interactive submission requires a Git worktree and a nonempty diff for the claimed files. This gate proves task ownership, recorded tool evidence, and review sequence; it does not make a passing test or a model conclusion inherently correct.

## Review flow

The coordinator runs these stages in order:

1. Tech Lead, Staff Engineer, and QA Engineer each independently investigate the same topic and publish a work card. Their work-card prompts do not include another role's conclusion.
2. Each role receives the same three work cards and independently cross-examines the other roles' claims, evidence, omissions, alternatives, and trade-offs.
3. For at most two revision rounds, every role publishes a response and revised work card that resolves every open challenge assigned to that role. The revision must explain the evidence, decision, and remaining risk behind each response, then propose actionable next steps with an owner or decision maker, scope, and acceptance condition.
4. Tech Lead, Staff Engineer, and QA Engineer independently verify the same set of three revised work cards. Their current-round verification answers are not shared until all three are complete.
5. All three verifiers must approve. A valid rejection creates the next revision round; exhausting the cap rejects the review.
6. Tech Lead writes consensus from the visible evidence, followed by immutable Staff Engineer and QA Engineer sign-off.

Initial work cards must contain visible Markdown headings with nonempty body content for `Conclusion`, `Evidence`, `Assumptions and Unknowns`, `Alternatives and Trade-offs`, `Self-Refutation Conditions`, and `Questions for Peers`. Revised work cards additionally require `Challenge Responses` and `Recommended Actions`. `Challenge Responses` explains why each issue can be closed and what risk remains; `Recommended Actions` turns the discussion into a proposed owner or decision maker, scope, and acceptance condition. Missing any required heading or leaving its body empty rejects the review. The transcript shares these auditable materials, not hidden model reasoning. Each role still has its own in-memory session, role-local memory, and configured Skill set; role sessions load no extensions or custom tools.

Every role stage has a total wall-clock deadline independent of the provider HTTP idle timeout. The default is 120 seconds. When that deadline expires, Pi aborts the active role session, rejects the review with `stage-timeout`, and continues through normal cleanup and report writing rather than waiting indefinitely.

## Challenge ledger

Every required cross-examination change must use its own exact marker, followed by evidence, impact, and an acceptance condition:

```text
ISSUE: STAFF-1 | TARGET: qa-engineer
```

Use an uppercase unique ID such as `STAFF-1` or `QA-1` and target another role. A role cannot target itself. During cross-examination, every reviewer must explicitly cover both peer roles. For each peer, emit one or more issue markers targeted at that peer, or this exact marker on its own line:

```text
NO ISSUES | TARGET: qa-engineer
```

Plain `NO ISSUES` remains shorthand for both peers only. It cannot coexist with an `ISSUE` marker or a targeted `NO ISSUES` marker. A targeted `NO ISSUES` marker may coexist with issues for the other peer. Do not emit it for a peer that already has an issue; normal agent responses sometimes add it as a redundant "no additional issues" summary, which is tolerated and does not cancel the recorded issues.

Each role revision must include this exact marker for every open challenge assigned to that role. Do not emit a resolution marker when no challenge is assigned:

```text
RESOLUTION: STAFF-1 | RESOLVED
```

The marker is only the ledger transition. The revised work card must also explain the response in `Challenge Responses` and convert the resulting decision into testable `Recommended Actions`; a marker alone does not constitute team discussion or a delivery plan.

Missing, duplicated, unknown, self-targeted, or malformed issue and resolution markers reject the review. A verification rejection must add at least one new targeted `ISSUE` marker; a rejection without a new issue is rejected as unsupported rather than silently retried.

## Evidence labels

Every factual claim should carry one of these labels:

| Label | Meaning | Expected treatment |
|-------|---------|--------------------|
| `L1` | Verified | Cite the concrete file, tool output, test result, or authoritative source. |
| `L2` | High confidence | State the technical basis, but do not present it as directly verified. |
| `L3` | Needs verification | State what is uncertain and how to check it. |
| `L4` | Unknown or doubtful | Say that it is unknown; do not convert it into a conclusion. |

An `L1` label requires cited evidence. A role's confidence alone does not raise a claim to `L1`.

## Approval gates

All three verification stages and both final sign-off stages are fail-closed. An approval must use this marker on its own line:

```text
VERDICT: APPROVE
```

Each verification prompt requires its response's final nonblank line to be exactly `VERDICT: APPROVE` or exactly `VERDICT: REJECT`. A verifier that rejects must emit at least one new targeted issue marker before that final verdict line. During verification, an exact `VERDICT: REJECT` plus at least one new targeted issue enters the next collaborative revision round. A missing marker, duplicate marker, marker with extra whitespace, malformed marker, or rejection without a new issue rejects the review immediately. After two unsuccessful revision rounds, the review is rejected and archived. A final Staff or QA sign-off rejection is terminal: it preserves the immutable consensus and transcript in the report, but the process exits nonzero.

## Per-role configuration

Create `.pi/ansteel.json` in the project being reviewed. The `model` field is required for every role, and all three configured `provider/model` values must be distinct by default. Missing, invalid, duplicate, or unavailable role models reject the review before any role session is created.

```json
{
  "roles": {
    "tech-lead": {
      "model": "<provider-a>/<model-id-a>",
	  "tools": ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"],
	  "teamTools": ["read", "grep", "find", "ls", "bash", "edit", "write"],
      "memoryFile": ".pi/ansteel-memory/tech-lead.md",
      "skillPaths": [".pi/ansteel-skills/tech-lead"]
    },
    "staff-engineer": {
      "model": "<provider-b>/<model-id-b>",
      "thinkingLevel": "high",
	  "tools": ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"]
    },
    "qa-engineer": {
      "model": "<provider-c>/<model-id-c>",
	  "tools": ["read", "grep", "find", "ls"]
    }
  },
  "reportDirectory": ".pi/ansteel-reports",
  "stageTimeoutMs": 120000,
	"maxToolCallsPerStage": 8,
	"teamTaskOwners": ["staff-engineer"],
	"allowSingleModel": false
}
```

Set `allowSingleModel` to `true` only for an intentional same-model discussion. It retains independent role sessions, role tools, challenge gates, and QA veto. The report marks it `Diversity status: SINGLE_MODEL_CONFIGURED`; it must not be interpreted as cross-model verification. With the default `false`, Pi requires distinct configured/resolved role identities, but reports `Diversity status: UNVERIFIED` because this version does not verify that those identities reach distinct backend models, provider endpoints, or providers.

`model` must use the exact `provider/model` form known to Pi, and that provider must have configured authentication. There is no current-model fallback.

`thinkingLevel` is optional per role and accepts `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`. Pi clamps the selected level to the configured model's supported levels. Set it explicitly when a provider requires thinking to be enabled; it does not change the role's tool or governance permissions.

`memoryFile` is optional and names one role-local Markdown or text file inside the reviewed project. Its content is added only to that role's session as fallible background context. `skillPaths` is an optional array of role-local Skill files or directories inside the reviewed project. Ansteel sessions load only the paths listed for their own role; ordinary project and user Skills remain disabled during a review. A missing configured memory file rejects setup; a missing Skill path is reported by Pi's resource loader.

Keep API credentials out of `.pi/ansteel.json`. Configure authentication through Pi's existing provider settings or environment variables, and use separate provider aliases in each role's `provider/model` value when the roles need distinct API keys or endpoints.

`tools` configures only the non-interactive `--ansteel` review. Use the bounded read-only tools `read`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`. Review roles cannot execute arbitrary shell commands and cannot read coordinator state such as historical reports, team state, role memory, Skills, or sessions. No batch-review role can receive `edit`, `write`, or SDK custom tools through this field.

`teamTools` configures interactive team sessions independently. It is optional and defaults to `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `bash`, `edit`, and `write`. The task tools are always present in interactive team mode. Even when `edit`, `write`, or `bash` are listed, task ownership remains enforced: `edit` and `write` require an active exact-file claim, `bash` is limited to read-only inspection, and the only test execution path is `ansteel_submit_change`.

`teamTaskOwners` controls which interactive roles may claim code-change tasks. It defaults to `["staff-engineer"]`; Tech Lead or QA may only claim changes when explicitly listed, for example `["staff-engineer", "tech-lead"]`. The selected policy is written into the team state when the team starts; a changed policy rejects a resume rather than silently changing an existing team's authority. The other roles still independently review every submitted task.

`reportDirectory` is resolved from the project directory and must remain inside it. Omit it to use the default `.pi/ansteel-reports` location.

`stageTimeoutMs` is optional and defaults to `120000`. It must be an integer from `1` through `2147483647` milliseconds and cannot be disabled. The limit covers an entire role stage, including tool use and provider retries; it is separate from Pi's provider HTTP idle timeout. It applies to both `--ansteel` review stages and interactive team investigations or task reviews; an interactive timeout aborts the role when possible and records a public `role-failure` event.

`maxToolCallsPerStage` is optional and defaults to `4`. It must be an integer from `1` through `32`. A tool request beyond the configured budget rejects the current review stage rather than allowing an unbounded tool loop.

## Reports and governance evidence

Every completed approval or rejection writes a complete, unedited Markdown transcript to `.pi/ansteel-reports/` by default. A configuration, model-resolution, or role-session construction failure also writes a sanitized rejected setup report, even when the configuration could not be parsed. The filename includes a UTC timestamp and a topic-derived slug.

`Governance result` records whether the required role review, verification, and sign-off gates passed. It does not mean the reviewed task was implemented, proven, or otherwise delivered. `Delivery result` is therefore always `NOT_DELIVERED` for `--ansteel`; read the consensus and evidence sections for the review's feasibility conclusion and any next engineering task.

The report records the result, challenge ledger, revision-round outcomes, complete role responses, configured/resolved role identities, and Tech Lead consensus when it exists. It intentionally stores neither credentials nor raw provider endpoints. A distinct configured-identity check does not prove backend model or provider diversity, and it does not prove that any factual claim is true. Retain cited file, tool, test, or source evidence; model identity configuration supplements rather than replaces it.
